Suppose you are given a table of currency exchange rates, represented as a 2D array. Determine whether 
there is a possible arbitrage: that is, whether there is some sequence of trades you can make, starting 
with some amount A of any currency, so that you can end up with some amount greater than A of that currency.

Example of input: 
    [(Dollar, Euro, 0.88), 
     (Euro, Dollar, 1.12),
     (Dollar, Yen, 0.75),
     ...]

First step build a table using the input data:
             Dollar Euro  Yen ....
    Dollar       0  0.88 0.75
    Euro      1.12     0  ...
    Yen        ...
    ...

At google I was asked if a possible translation was possible. This is a very vague question
a possible answer to discuss with the examiner would be starting with one currency perform a
breadth-first search using as accumulated value 1 and perform the multiplication.
For example code the code in python for that would be:
    
    dollar_row = 0
    frontier = [(dollar_row, 1)]

    while frontier:
        currency, accumulated = frontier.pop()

        if currency in visited:
            continue

        for other_currency, value in enumerate(currencies[currency]):
            frontier.append(other_currency, accumulated * value)


Example of the execution
    frontier = [(Dollar, 1)]
    other_currencies = [Euro, Yen]
    frontier ((Euro, 0.88), (Yen, 1.12))
